Who Opened Record LWC
Overview
The "Who Opened Record" Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to enhance Case management in Salesforce by tracking the first user who opens a Case record. This component automatically updates a specified lookup field on the Case record with the user who opens it, providing valuable insights into the initial interaction with the case.
