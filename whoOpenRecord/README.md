# Who Opened Record LWC

The "Who Opened Record" Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to enhance Case management in Salesforce by tracking the first user who opens a Case record. This component automatically updates a specified lookup field on the Case record with the user who opens it, providing valuable insights into the initial interaction with the case.

### Usage
- Add the "Who Opened Record" Lightning Web Component to the Case record page layout in Salesforce.
- Configure the component by specifying the lookup field (ApiName) on the Case object that should be updated.
- Once added, the component will automatically update the designated field with the user's information upon opening the Case record.
